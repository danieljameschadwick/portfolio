                                I was formally introduced to PHP in 2015, but had previous experience using the
                                language, and have been using it for both professional and personal projects. I started
                                off with processing scripts for orders, email scheduling, product management and moved
                                on to Content Management Systems and then onto frameworks such as Symfony.

                                I have been using SQL since working at my IT apprenticeship. I was first introduced to
                                MySQL/MariaDB and PostgreSQL for help storing my data structures for reports, product
                                management (stock) and email subscriber lists. I have used other SQL variants such as
                                MSSQL and Oracle whilst studying. I am proficient in creating my own schemas for complex
                                data systems such as my work recently on an expandable Survey system using Doctrine and
                                relating it to a MySQL 8.0 database.

                                HTML/CSS markup have been one of my first skills I learnt around 10 years ago. I am very
                                comfortable designing frontend websites for anything from CMS, dashboards, product
                                pages, and email templates. Recently, I have adapted my skills using CSS into adopting
                                Less for my CSS processing as it allows for much cleaner stylesheets that are much
                                easier to follow.

                                click event handling but over the years I have used JS in modern applications. Whilst
                                routing API calls I have used JavaScript to communicate with Symfony APIs to populate
                                dashboard data. Furthermore, I developed a 2D canvas which handled object collisions in
                                JS - whilst at University.

                                I first started testing at University whilst learning C#. Unit Testing was core to the
                                curriculum and thus good practices have carried over to other such testing in PHP
                                (PHPUnit). I am confident in being able to write testable code which can ensure the
                                robustness of any application. I have experience writing Behat tests to functionally
                                test at my applications. One of the main ways I have applied Behat is through using
                                Mink, Selenium and Chrome headless browsing for automated tests to emulate user
                                behaviour.

                                I learnt the fundamentals of RabbitMQ whilst working for Wren Kitchens and use messages
                                for queuing background processes. I have applied this learning whilst developing a CSV
                                parser for Wren Kitchens for stock items. Each CSV would be published and consumed by
                                the parser for bulk processing to a MySQL database.

                                I used ElasticSearch in the aforementioned CSV parser to efficiently search through the
                                parsed stock table which was populated through Symfony application using FOSElastica.
                                Anytime a CSV was parsed the Elastic structure was re-populated.

            <p>Graduate Computer Science Student at the University of Hull. Currently working at Wren Kitchens as a
                Junior PHP Developer. Prior to studying, I worked for 2 years at an online eCommerce Workwear Retailer
                as
                a Full Stack Apprentice working on PHP store management systems, scripts and website development (both
                internal and external). Whilst at
                University I studied mainly C# but have worked with Java, JavaScript, PHP, C++, and C. On the data side,
                SQL was studied thoroughly. </p>
            <p>Currently working at Wren Kitchens as part of the IT Development team. Wren's core systems are
                developed on the Symfony framework. I work maintaining these systems across the full stack from backend,
                Symfony Framework, to the frontend using modern JavaScript frameworks, Twig, and Less/CSS. Although
                my experiences are mainly on the backend I have a wealth of experience creating interactive and
                intuitive user experiences.</p>

                            <p>As part of my Graduate training scheme at Wren Kitchens I developed a product
                                descriptions CSV parser which utilised: Symfony (PHP7) for the stack, RabbitMQ for
                                handing off of the parsing process, Elastic for searching through product descriptions,
                                and SQL for the data persistence.

                                Also utilised was JavaScript for file upload handling and AJAX hand-off. For styling,
                                CSS/LESS was used to manage stylesheets all through Webpack Encore.

                            <p>As part of my dissertation, whilst studying at the University of Hull, I completed a
                                bespoke business application specifically for breweries. The main idea was to have a
                                wide array of stock management options to enable proactive stocking through an Android
                                application.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The final project saw a solid Stock Inventory system written in C# driven by a PHP
                                RESTful API built upon a MySQL database. A C# Point of Sale application with
                                order processing was also completed in the same application. Furthermore, an Android
                                application was also initially developed to handle stock scanning/reading and editing on
                                the go.

                                statuses, processor health checks, sales reporting, email marketing statistics, etc.

                                The dashboard utilised PHP for the executing of database queries and the data was
                                displayed in, mostly, CSS grids or JQuery Flotcharts dependant on the data. This made
